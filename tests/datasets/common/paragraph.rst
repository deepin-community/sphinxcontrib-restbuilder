Single line

Two short
lines.

Lines continued \
with backslash.

Single    line     with    multiple spaces.

A long line that goes on and on and on and on and on and really is so lang that it will be wrapped at some point. Well, at least it should really be wrapped by now, because really, this is a long sentence, eh?

A line with a very long word is abcdefghijklmoqprstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmoqprstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmoqprstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmoqprstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmoqprstuvwxyz. Long or what?
